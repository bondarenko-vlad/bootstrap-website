      <p class="lead">
Helping Homeless Pets works to support legitimate and ethical Russian pet rescue organizations, by assisting them with fundraising for medical care, public awareness and education.  This allows our members to better focus on the care and finding of a suitable home for the pets they have rescued.

Each pet listed on our members' websites and social media has been saved by a member rescue organization, evaluated, given proper medical care and prepared for adoption through that organization. </p>

      <p class="lead mb-0">Our history
Helping Homeless Pets will created in future to help volunteer-based pet rescue organizations who help unwanted pets get a second chance at a new home, and who help reduce the number of pets that may become homeless or abandoned.  We do this by directly supporting our member pet rescue groups, giving them opportunities to liaise and help each other with transports, assessments and home visits, and by helping to publicly raise awareness and educate current and future pet owners.  We are working to unite pet rescues across Canada, in the knowledge that by working together we can rescue more homeless pets and prevent future homeless pets.
HHP requires that our member rescues observe a Code of Conduct.  A Code of Ethics is also in place for dog and cat rescues.</p>
